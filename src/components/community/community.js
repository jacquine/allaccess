            <p>Use the museumâ€™s wheelchair map for the best route through the museum. Galleries are spacious, and the elevator to each floor was big enough for my chair. Great visit! </p>

            <p>My mother appreciated the large print labels and braille throughout. We attended a verbal description tour and had a wonderful visit. </p>

            <h6>General - User Review</h6>
            <p>The Sensory Map is so helpful - we found a quiet spot to decompress after we passed through the busier galleries. Take a break when you need it for a long day at the museum. </p>
